This is an implementation of the stress-based topology optimization presented in (1),
with some minor enhancements for comparison with a new methodology. It is based on
[Galerkin](https://github.com/slmcbane/Galerkin) for FEM primitives, and the open source
[Ipopt](https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt) to solve the resultant nonlinear programming
problem.
